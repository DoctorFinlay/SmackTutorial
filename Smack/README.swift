 This is what I have learnt as a result of writing this app:
 
 1) Using Cocoapods to import things like SWRevealView
 2) Using @IBDesignable to allow IB to show custom classes
 3) Using Alamofire
 4) Using SwiftyJSON to parse JSON is much quicker than native Swift
 5) How to set up a spinner
 6) The importance of using constants in a separate file
 7) public private(set) as a shortcut to encapsulate data
 8) How to use collection views
 9) Using PostMan to see how to send and properly parse web requests
 10)Practical uses for singletons
