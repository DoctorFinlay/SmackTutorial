# SmackTutorial
App tutorial from Devslopes - integrating REST , JSON, alamofire, SwiftyJSON and socket.io

I made this whilst following the Devslopes "Smack" app tutorial to learn how to correctly work with:
  1)alamofire 
  2)sockets.io
  3)swiftyJSON
  
  This is what I have learnt as a result of writing this app:
  
  1) Using Cocoapods to import things like SWRevealView
  2) Using @IBDesignable to allow IB to show custom classes
  3) Using Alamofire
  4) Using SwiftyJSON to parse JSON is much quicker than native Swift
  5) How to set up a spinner
  6) The importance of using constants in a separate file
  7) public private(set) as a shortcut to encapsulate data
  8) How to use collection views
  9) Using PostMan to see how to send and properly parse web requests
  10)Practical uses for singletons
